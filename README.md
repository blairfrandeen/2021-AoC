# 2021 Advent of Code

Using 2021 [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) as a means to teach myself C. Resources for learning C are:

- The C Programming Language (Kernigan & Ritchie)
- [C Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=display)
- University of Nebraska-Lincoln [Computer Science I](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4IH6CVPpTZVkiEnCEOdGbYsFEdtKc5Bx) videos by Chris Bourke
- My dad, who has been programming longer than you.

Goal is to complete 2021 AoC by 1/31/2022.
